# Challenges

## List of design problems

1) Creating hard-coded unique fields in DB like domain, email or generic main_field ?

Custom field like domain or email should be better for start 
because it will works only for specific / niche use cases instead working for all
so the system will be less complex from the development / ui / marketing point of view
